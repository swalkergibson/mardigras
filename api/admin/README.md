API Admin
=========
The api directory rewrites all requests to the api's index.php file, creating an issue if ever an administration page should be created. Thus, the api and the admin area are in seperate directories for simply resolution to the issue

For the time being
-------------------
for now I am using this directory to test some OAuth stuff, as I can access files directly here. If this kind of directory is needed more in the future I will just create a dev directory ;-)

Potential Uses
--------------
Potential uses of the administration directory include OAuth credential management and viewing of error logs.
