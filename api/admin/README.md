API Admin
=========
The api directory rewrites all requests to the api's index.php file, creating an issue if ever an administration page should be created. Thus, the api and the admin area are in seperate directories for simple resolution to the issue

Potential Uses
--------------
Potential uses of the administration directory include OAuth2 credential management and viewing of error logs.
